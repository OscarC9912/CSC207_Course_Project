# CSC207_Course_Project

This is the Course Project of CSC207 Software Design at University of Toronto, collectively completed with my teammates.
* The specific ReadMe of each phase of development is included in folders, respectively.
* What we develop is a smart Course Schedule App that aims to facilitate the Undergrads at University of Toronto St George with their course arrangements.
